# XEDq

XEDq brings [Intel XED](https://github.com/intelxed/xed) powers into [Go](https://golang.org/) space.

## What it is

Convenient library built on top of **Intel XED** for encoding/decoding of 
[X86](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) instructions.

Focused around two use cases:
1. Manually-coded expressions: succinct and readable API, easy to use.
2. Programmatically built expressions: composable API, easy to extend.
